## üéØ Features

- **CPU Stress Testing**: Utilizes multiple CPU cores with prime number calculations
- **RAM Stress Testing**: Allocates and actively uses memory with multi-threaded workers
- **Network Stress Testing**: Client/Server mode for bandwidth and connection testing
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Color-coded output with timestamps and progress updates
- **Zero Dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable duration, cores, memory size, and more

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Linux operating system (tested on Ubuntu/Debian)
- Root/sudo access recommended for certain stress levels

## üöÄ Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stress-test-tool.git
cd stress-test-tool

# Make the script executable
chmod +x stress_test.py

# Run it!
./stress_test.py --help
```

### System-wide Installation (Optional)

```bash
# Copy to /usr/local/bin for system-wide access
sudo cp stress_test.py /usr/local/bin/stress-test
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/stress-test

# Now you can run it from anywhere
stress-test cpu --duration 30
```

## üìñ Usage

### CPU Stress Test

Test your CPU cores with intensive prime number calculations:

```bash
# Use all available CPU cores for 60 seconds
./stress_test.py cpu --duration 60

# Use specific number of cores
./stress_test.py cpu --cores 4 --duration 30

# Longer stress test
./stress_test.py cpu --cores 8 --duration 300
```

**Parameters:**
- `--cores`: Number of CPU cores to use (default: all available)
- `--duration`: Test duration in seconds (default: 60)

### RAM Stress Test

Allocate and actively use system memory:

```bash
# Allocate 1GB of RAM for 60 seconds
./stress_test.py ram --size 1024 --duration 60

# Allocate 4GB with 8 threads
./stress_test.py ram --size 4096 --threads 8 --duration 120

# Heavy memory test
./stress_test.py ram --size 8192 --threads 16 --duration 300
```

**Parameters:**
- `--size`: Memory to allocate in MB (default: 1024)
- `--threads`: Number of worker threads (default: 4)
- `--duration`: Test duration in seconds (default: 60)

### Network Stress Test

Test network bandwidth and connection handling:

#### Server Mode

```bash
# Start server on default port (9999)
./stress_test.py network --mode server --duration 120

# Custom host and port
./stress_test.py network --mode server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --duration 300
```

#### Client Mode

```bash
# Connect to local server with 4 clients
./stress_test.py network --mode client --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9999 --clients 4 --duration 120

# Connect to remote server with 8 clients
./stress_test.py network --mode client --host 192.168.1.100 --port 9999 --clients 8 --duration 300
```

**Parameters:**
- `--mode`: `server` or `client` (required)
- `--host`: Host address (default: 127.0.0.1)
- `--port`: Port number (default: 9999)
- `--clients`: Number of concurrent clients (client mode only, default: 4)
- `--duration`: Test duration in seconds (default: 60)

## üí° Use Cases

### 1. **System Performance Testing**
Validate that your server can handle expected workloads:
```bash
# Simulate high CPU load
./stress_test.py cpu --cores 16 --duration 600
```

### 2. **Memory Leak Detection**
Monitor system behavior under sustained memory pressure:
```bash
# Watch htop in another terminal while running
./stress_test.py ram --size 8192 --duration 1800
```

### 3. **Network Capacity Testing**
Test network throughput and connection limits:
```bash
# Terminal 1 (Server)
./stress_test.py network --mode server --port 9999 --duration 300

# Terminal 2 (Client)
./stress_test.py network --mode client --port 9999 --clients 16 --duration 300
```

### 4. **Load Balancer Testing**
Verify load balancer behavior under stress:
```bash
# Point multiple clients at your load balancer
./stress_test.py network --mode client --host lb.example.com --port 80 --clients 50 --duration 600
```

### 5. **Thermal Testing**
Test cooling solutions under sustained load:
```bash
# Watch temperatures with: watch -n 1 sensors
./stress_test.py cpu --duration 1800
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring with htop

```bash
# Install htop if not already installed
sudo apt-get install htop

# Run in another terminal
htop
```

### Memory Monitoring

```bash
# Watch memory usage
watch -n 1 free -h
```

### Network Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor network connections
watch -n 1 'ss -s'

# Monitor bandwidth
sudo apt-get install iftop
sudo iftop -i eth0
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Warnings

- **Start Small**: Begin with shorter durations and fewer resources
- **Monitor Temperature**: Watch CPU/GPU temperatures during stress tests
- **Save Your Work**: Close important applications before running stress tests
- **Resource Limits**: Don't allocate more RAM than physically available
- **Production Systems**: Use caution on production servers - run during maintenance windows

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "MemoryError: Unable to allocate..."
You're trying to allocate more memory than available. Reduce the `--size` parameter.

### "Address already in use" (Network test)
The port is already in use. Choose a different port with `--port` or stop the conflicting service.

### Script runs but no CPU usage
Make sure you have permission to create processes. Try with `sudo` if needed.

### Permission denied
Make the script executable: `chmod +x stress_test.py`
